Ramon Blanco answered -
Thanks for your question. As stated in the EES IA, we need to evaluate accuracy on a monthly basis -> we will assess quality as well.

John J. Howard asked : Slide 6 says that a unified quality score should "depend on all factors that can influence face recognition performance".  Demographics can influence face recognition performance (males matched to males have higher FMR than females matched to males).  Should quality depend on demographics?
5 upvotes | 4 answers | 2 replies

Patrick Grother answered -
I think idea is all factors measurable in the image, particularly departures from canonical frontal photo, such as pose, illumination, expression etc. 

Johannes Merkle answered -
Only factors that can be influenced / remedied should determine the unified quality score (UQS). However, we don't know, what factors influence the outputs of CNNs computiing a UQS. This may be a good reason not to use a CNN for the UQS in OFIQ, but to fuse the outputs of the other algorithms (relating to specific aspects) included in OFIQ. Such a fusion, however, should only use the outputs of measures that are relevant for face recognition.   

John J. Howard replied -
Thanks Patrick/Johannes -- I'm finding "performance" in the quality context is sometimes an overloaded term.


Johannes Merkle answered -
Here, I mean face recognition accuracy

John J. Howard replied -
The formula for accuracy includes false positive counts.  So things that increase false positive rates would be included for consideration in your universal quality score?

Johannes Merkle answered -
Good question, which has also bveen discussed in Jim's talk. Clearly, very poorly illuminated images (where a lot of details are lost) are more susceptoble to false positives and the same might apply for extreme poses (from behind, many persons look similar ;-) ) 
However, as Jim said, mated score are much more stable w.r.t quality aspects than non-mated scores. Thus, we will only consider mated scores (error discard curves) in our evaluation.  


[08:05 AM]
John Campbell asked : As SOTA algorithms become better and less sensitive to certain factors (such as pose or illumination or sharpness) how will the quality metrics and capture guidance in the standards 
be updated?
3 upvotes | 2 answers | 0 reply

Patrick Grother answered -
One way would be to relax quality rejection thresholds, as was done with NFIQ 1.

Johannes Merkle answered -
Indeed, the requirements and recommendations may need to be adjusted if there is no impact on biometric verification. However, we do not only need to take into account face recognition algorithms but also manual verification and other biometric algorithms, like morph attack detection or PAD.  


[08:40 AM]
Yevgeniy B. Sirotin asked : Is there any information on whether quality measures vary for individuals that belong to different demographic groups?
3 upvotes | 3 answers | 1 reply

Benjamin Tams answered -
I am not sure, if this question goes in my direction. But, I think this is hard to answer. On the one side, it is frequently reported that recognition performance depends on demographics and since quality assessment should predict recognition performance it should then also vary for different demographic groups. On the other hand, biometric algorithmics should be unbiased. Also, and this is another point to consider, our quality assessment should be matcher-agnostic but predict recognition performance, anyway. So, I cannot fully answer your question.

Patrick Grother answered -
Generally they do - tests warranted. As Benjamin said, any algorithm operating on face images could be biased.

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin replied -
If quality scores vary with demographics, they image rejection may also be more frequent for some groups than others.  Is that a correct conclusion if image quality is included in the process?

Johannes Merkle answered -
That depends on the algorithm. For instance, an algorithm assessing under exposure could frequently output false positives for subjects with dark skin. We will try to avoid this by performing evluations on a large variety of images and data sets. But there are limitations. For instance, an algorithm aiming to detect unnatural colors yould fail for subjects with severe sun burn or port-wine stains (ok, this is not a deomagraphic factor but a medical one)

Doris asked : How fast does the face quality algorithm provide feedback? Will it always be possible to ask for a re-capture or does the person move on to manual verification?
2 upvotes | 1 answer | 0 reply

Ramon Blanco answered -
Thanks for your question. The quality calculation happens within the USK at MS level so the reply is almost immediate (sorry that cannot go in further details). The decision of going to 2nd line is on MS hands, so it is the border guard decision

Terry asked : Is face "lightness" affected by image camera exposure?
2 upvotes | 1 answer | 1 reply

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin answered -
Face lightness is a property of the individual and not the image.  We measured face lightness of each person.  Face lightness in images of the person can vary dramatically across cameras - likely because of exposure.

Terry replied -
I'm curious if the points on your graph move horizontally with respect to measured lightness.


[11:27 AM]
Luna VAN LANY asked : In regard to the data of 2021 Biometric Technology Rally: is poor accuracy mostly due to false positives or to false negatives? 

2 upvotes | 2 answers | 0 reply

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin answered -
The Rally primarily measures false negatives.

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin answered -
75% of the errors were actually due to failures of image acquisition - not matching.  This may be an issue with face detection or quality benchmarks for individuals with darker skin.


[07:15 AM]
Christian Halet asked : Do you think that very low yaw, tilt for face quality will not be a limiting factor for self service kiosk? New facial matching is allowing larger variation without degrading too much performance.

could ofiq be used on the frvt test?
1 upvote | 2 answers | 0 reply

Johannes Merkle answered -
Yes, we will submit our prototype implementations (comprising several candidates for some quality aspects) to FRVT QA

Patrick Grother answered -
Yes OFIQ will be submitted into the SIDD track of FRVT

Chamberlin -DHS asked : Ben,  did you have enough data about the specific 29794-5 vector values?  And what group or groups, reviewed the data - in terms of privacy, quantity, etc.. to approve your use of the data?
1 upvote | 2 answers | 0 reply

Benjamin Tams answered -
Thank you for your question. We will perform internal pre-evaluations to reduce shortlisted implementations and reduce the amount of FRVT submission. But the final result will be in the evaluation report of SIDD.

Johannes Merkle answered -
We mainly use public datasets. For aspects, where no eligible datasets (having corresponding labels) are avlailable (e.g. specular reflections), we perform small scale evaluations on self-captured images. 


[08:34 AM]
Zsuzsanna Bartha asked : How do you plan to weight the effect of different parameters on the unified quality score in the OFIQ?
1 upvote | 3 answers | 1 reply

Benjamin Tams answered -
Thank you for your question. There will (as per current working draft of 29794-5) be a calibration of the unified quality score to match a pre-defined contribution on the LFW dataset.

Johannes Merkle answered -
There are tow options for the unified quality score (UQS): 
1. Use a CNN taking the whole imnage as input, e.g. MagFace or SSD-FIQA. In this case, we don't know what factors influence the UQS. 
2. Fuse the outputs of other algorithms (relating to specific aspects) included in OFIQ. Such a fusion, however, should only use the outputs of measures that are relevant for face recognition. Even if the fusion is performed by machine learning, the influence of the individual aspects can be determined by computing the feature importance. 

Zsuzsanna Bartha replied -
Thanks!

Johannes Merkle answered -
We will definiely evaluate both approaches 


[08:51 AM]
Sylvia Fichthorn asked : Has any consideration been given to people(s) who have undergone plastic surgery/surgeries, received Botox/filler injections, and/or other invasive cosmetic procedures that alter their appearance minimally/dramatically, with or without the natural aging process in consideration?
1 upvote | 1 answer | 1 reply

Patrick Grother answered -
That's mostly a question about FR performance when comparing two images. The algorithms discussed today consider quality of one image.  Typical surgery or botox would not be expected to greatly change quality measures.

Sylvia Fichthorn replied -
Thanks!

Chamberlin -DHS asked : Florian, is there a National guideline on how to collect face images and how does it address religious head coverings at time of collection.
1 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Johannes Merkle answered -
ISO/IEC 19794-5:2001 recommends that head coverings (e.g. hats, caps, headscarves) are absent, except in cases, where a covering cannot be removed, e.g. due to religious reasons. Similarly, 
I can only report on the ISO standards: 
ISO/IEC 39794-5:2019 requires that head coverings shall not be accepted except in circumstances specifically approved by the issuing state.

[11:24 AM]
Doris asked : would using black and white photo result in better performance overall?
1 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin answered -
Datasets used to train FR are not color calibrated and algorithms likely therefore discard this information - however images of faces that are darker may carry lower signal to noise and are more prone to under-exposure, potentially because camera manufacturers tend to target lighter colors for imaging.

0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Ramon Blanco answered -
Thanks for your question. If "the providers" are biometric providers to MS, we are really encouraging MS to use the USK (they are not obliged). If not, as written in the EES IA, their algorithms shall correlate with the USK ones. sBMS will check this fact

0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Patrick Grother answered -
Hi Ilan, Photographic setups appear in ISO/IEC 39794-5 and it's predecessor 19794-5.  Not for phones, where distortion could be a problem at least in selfies.  


[08:12 AM]
Tawsin asked : are CNN based approaches (e.g. SDD-FIQA) reliable for biometric face image quality assessment because most of the SOTA FIQA CNN models are trained on wild faces (e.g. VGGFace); not on the images that are ISO-29794-5 compliance?

0 upvote | 1 answer | 1 reply

Johannes Merkle answered -
For face recognition, the CNNs trained on in the wild datasets are superiour even on ISO-compliant images. We think that the same applies to QA algorithms. However, we don't rely on this assumption, but perform evaluations of candidate algorithms on images that we consider relevant for the typical application scenarios (as far as available).

Tawsin replied -
Yes. It is interesting to see if SOTA CNN based FIQA models are reliable in the bio-metrics authentication scenario.

0 upvote | 1 answer | 1 reply

Johannes Merkle answered -
For many aspects, e.g. natural colors, there may be some subjects where the algorithms may fail. Personally, I don't think that there will ever be a perfect solution. But don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. For such cases, real world applications need fall-back solutions, e.g. an operator overriding the algorithm's assesssment.  

Gabriel H replied -
Thanks!

Benjamin Tams answered -
Thank you for your question. No, we do not consider to consider age variations. Do you mean the age of the subject?

Johannes Merkle answered -
Unfortunately, there are not many datasets having large age variations and labels for age AND quality aspects.

Mahesh Kumar Sharma replied -
Yes. Thanks for the clarification.



[08:29 AM]
Greg Fiumara asked : In terms of code/system portability, especially when including quality components that employ CNNs, are there plans to allow deviations of unified quality scores (e.g., accepting +/- some value) when the OFIQ is computed on different CPU architectures, operating systems, etc.?
0 upvote | 2 answers | 0 reply

Benjamin Tams answered -
Thank you for your question. Yes, we are planning to conduct harmonisation tests for OFIQ and guarantee portability for several platforms.

Johannes Merkle answered -
Certain deviations will be inevitable due to arithmetic implementation details, but these should be limited to the minimum necesary. This minimum will be determined in the project.

Asif Khan asked : How do you detect face and facial landmarks, as most of these quality checks depend on accuracy and precision of facial landmark detection.
0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Benjamin Tams answered -
Thank you for your question. We want to avoid that multiple quality measures implementation recompute facial landmarks using different sub-implementations. We will provide a single landmark/face/... detectors. For landmark extraction, we succeeded in converting Google Mediapipe to ONNX and loading it via OpenCV 4.5

Udo Mahlmeister asked : How much does skin-specific color calibration help in the presence of auto white balance? Should AWB "gray out" skin tone to improve biometric performance?
0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin answered -
I think adjustment should be made based on diffuse face skin reflectance and not based on the whole scene.  I do not know if the goal should be to correctly reproduce L* or if the goal should be to ensure equal exposure for diffuse skin independent of actual L* of the individual.  Given variation in skin tone across images in biometric training sets, algorithms have potentially learned to ignore this feature.

Reflection in eyeglasses would probably be counted as semi-transparent (between fully transparent and fully opaque)  for the sunglasses measure.

Johannes Merkle replied -
But reflections of a flash could be compeletely obscuring the underlying textures

Relatively easy to curate sets, and test.  No plans given other factors to do.
