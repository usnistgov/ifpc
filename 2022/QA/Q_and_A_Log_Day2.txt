Anna asked : You say the face is not private - legally speaking, maybe this is correct in the US, but in Europe, according to GDPR, face IS private and your photos cannot be shared online without consent. Not all EU countries interpret GDPR so strictly, but many do.

Brendan Klare answered -
In the EU, for football/soccer match, shouldnt they have to blur all the faces in attendance then? I think this is why GDPR needs to be revisited. In some cases it doesnt make much sense in the context of how the world actually operates

Anna replied -
If you attend a public event in the EU, some countries ask you to provide consent that you are happy to be photographed / recorded when you register / buy your tickets.

Irina Orssich (EC DG CNECT) answered -
Normally not, unless manifestly made public ... But data protection authorities define this narrowly, for example in the clearview case

Richard Vorder Bruegge asked : Do I understand it that the High Risk example means that law enforcement could NOT use FR to scan video footage if a crime has happened?  For example, if there was evidence to indicate that a G20 protester was subsequently involved in a criminal act? 

2 upvotes | 1 answer | 1 reply

Irina Orssich (EC DG CNECT) answered -
They can (according to national law) scan after the event. The prohibition concerns "real-time".  Data protection rules need to be respected and the requirements of the AI Act complied with, but NO prohibition. 

Richard Vorder Bruegge replied -
Thank you!

Natalia Menéndez asked : How does it affect your emphasis on differentiating between biometric templates and facial images fact that SOTA FRT empowered by deep learning does not use biometric templates?
2 upvotes | 2 answers | 1 reply

Patrick Grother answered -
Isn't this just a definition problem: Industry uses the word "template" for the data that an AI developer of FRT would call an "embedding".  Is a "biometric template" different ?

Natalia Menéndez replied -
Completely agree, but we have, for instance seen this with the definition of AI on the AI Act, in law (but also in many other fields) words matter a lot.

Odhran McCarthy answered -
The emphasis about making a distinction between biometric templates and facial images was specifically an issues for policies around storage, retention and deletion

James R. Matey asked : Brendan,  Any chance that the algorithms have been specifically trained to do well on the images from PNAS?
2 upvotes | 3 answers | 0 reply

Brendan Klare answered -
Great question.  I showed results from our (Rank One's) algo I that slide, and I can guarantee that didnt happen with our algo. I cant say for others, but I'd say for legacy vendors it is possible, for newer vendors it is unlikely

Patrick Grother answered -
It's a tiny test set, results for which are buried in the report and have never been used for marketing. 

Brendan Klare answered -
Yeah, very tiny set

Irina Orssich (EC DG CNECT) answered -
If I understand the use case correctly, there is no high-risk.

Richard Vorder Bruegge asked : Sorry - cut and paste problems... continues question here: not collected by the law enforcement agency but instead by another party (e.g., bank security camera). Is RAND's policy analysis focusing on the distinction between forensic use of existing imagery vs. live face scanning / watchlisting?
1 upvote | 1 answer | 3 replies

Samuel Peterson answered -
Yes, we include some discussion around that. That's probably the biggest distinction across use types that we consider. It's also not generally being used by police in the US currently

Richard Vorder Bruegge replied -
Wow - you obviously did not talk with us, then.

Richard Vorder Bruegge replied -
This really concerns me about your study, because policy makers absolutely must understand that use case, otherwise blanket "bans" will put forensic analysis of such data at a great risk.

Richard Vorder Bruegge replied -
For example, in the most extreme case, a blanket ban on FR for video from body worn cameras after the fact would eliminate the possibility to conduct a search of an individual who attacks and kills an officer wearing a camera.  That type of scenario for "after the fact analysis" should be addressed in any comprehensive look at police use of FR.


[10:10 AM]
Sacha Refshauge asked : Isn't in the case that synthetic faces adopt the features of the images that the model is trained on? The generator also focuses on the face rather than background, lighting+noise. This explains why they look similar and why they also cluster so well. Would training it differently fool the detector?

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin asked : Brendan, what implications do you think handling twins will have on the resolution (i.e., pixels between the eyes) that will be required?  How much more information will we need?
1 upvote | 2 answers | 0 reply

Brendan Klare answered -
Very good question... I think twins will generally require high resolution to accurately differentiate, especially in the cases of younger twins

Brendan Klare answered -
Hard to say how much more info is ultimately needed, but probably a good gauge is whether or not freckles can be reliably observed 


[11:05 AM]
Richard Vorder Bruegge asked : On the freckle detail issue for twins - we established the ANSI-NIST Face Standard at Level 50/51 to meet or exceed 0.1 mm per pixel on the facial image. Roughly 2500x1700 pixels across the face. That should be more than enough   to get high skin level detail.

Stephan asked : How do you tackle the problem of re-evaluation after software updates?
1 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Michael Thieme answered -
this was answered in the chat ... one short cut to validate that a system is still performant after an update would be to test at the threshold / series where errors (e.g. APCER) started to occur - e.g. where you observed say 3% APCER. If the re-test results are in that general range that's probably sufficient validation. But to measure step-changes necessitates a new test at scale.

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin asked : What is the human reviewer directed to do by this standard?  To compare biometric images or to use orthogonal data?
0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Odhran McCarthy answered -
The framework recommends that the human facial examiner conduct an initial quality assessment of the probe image to ensure it is high enough quality for facial comparison. Once the search the is completed, the facial examiner should then analyze and manually compare the probe image with the proposed candidate list. If a possible match is made, a further facial exmainer should conduct a blind peer review.

Richard Vorder Bruegge asked : Odhran, use of the phrase "peer reviewer" is an unfortunate holdover from outdated forensic laboratory practice which leads to confusion with the "peer review" process in scientific literature.  We are trying to get the community to transition to the phrase Technical review (conducted by a "peer")

Thanks for sharing Richard and clarifying this. We went with language coming from and familiar to the law enforcement agencies participating in the process. But I appreciate your interests and motivation in moving away from this.

Richard Vorder Bruegge replied -
Understood.  Great piece of work... I hope we can help move it forward.

Cathrine Elisabeth Fari answered -
Hi Suzie! Thank you for you question! 
The e-learning will provide the students with basic knowledge of facial comparison. We will strive to also populate the digital training ground with CCTV images and other images of low quality to practice on.


[09:26 AM]
Richard Vorder Bruegge asked : Does your study address the use of FR to analyze seized data for triage purposes? I.e., when a large set of evidence is acquired, organizing it based on facial images is often necessary to quickly locate subjects of interest.
0 upvote | 1 answer | 0 reply

Samuel Peterson answered -
I think that's covered in our report under an "administrative uses" section. Although, we do note that there are concerns about analysis of large swaths of law enforcement data like body camera videos for facial images

Yevgeniy B. Sirotin asked : One of the challenges in testing PAD, is selection of species, which is an open set.  The resulting metrics are therefore dependent on this choice.  What guidance can be given for PAD species selection given the evolving threat?
0 upvote | 2 answers | 1 reply

Michael Thieme answered -
So in my opinion (weak answer) it's really use case dependent. Is the tester worried about nation-state actors vs YouTube hackers ... in some cases the point of the testing is to actually test emerging species. In our experience, we gain the most insights by testing state of the art, or the most sophisticated species that we can get access to. This gives us insights into some underlying system behaviors.

Thank you Michael.
